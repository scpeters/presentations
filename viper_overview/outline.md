# Using ROS 2 and Gazebo in NASA's VIPER project

## What is VIPER?

*  It's something of strategic importance for the US government: an acronym
*  [VIPER: Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover](https://www.nasa.gov/viper)
*  Translation: a robot for direct measuring ice at the south pole of the moon

## Wait, there's ice on the moon?

* Yes, thanks to the [Chandrayaan 1 mission](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/chandrayaan-1/in-depth/)
  we have observed [significant amounts of ice](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/chandrayaan-1/in-depth/)
  in the polar regions of the moon.
* There appears to be more at the south pole than the north pole

## Why is it only at the poles?

* With no atmosphere on the moon, ice is volatile, meaning that it will vaporize
  at very low temperatures
* The moon undergoes extreme temperature changes (260 C) during the two weeks of
  sunshine and two weeks of darkness for each lunar day, which would vaporize
  ice over most of the moon's surface
* But there are craters near the north and south pole of the moon that are in
  permanent shadow and cold enough to preserve ice (20 K). These craters never
  receive sunlight because of the axial tilt of the moon
* Whereas earth as a 23 degree axial tilt, which gives us seasons in temperate
  latitudes and 6 months of light and 6 months of darkness at the poles,
* The moon has only a 1.5 degree axial tilt with respect to the sun, so that
  sunlight at the poles is nearly always at the horizon
